In Florida, where two nurses will be observing your performance throughout the test, one nurse will observe your handwashing at the beginning of the first skill, and the other nurse will observe your handwashing at the end of the first skill. After the first skill is completed, for the remainder of the test, handwashing is evaluated as a part of Indirect Care with the checkpoint, 'Use Standard precautions and Infection Control Measures when providing care.' Handwashing is one of the five skills scored in every Clinical Skills Test.",
